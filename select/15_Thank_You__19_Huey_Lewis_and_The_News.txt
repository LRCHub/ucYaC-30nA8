(Sean Hopper/Huey Lewis)

[Sean explains this song pokes fun at all the songs titled "Thank you". Originally titled "Thank you #29", it seems it was renamed #19 because of a typo!]

I want to tell you 'cause it's true
I want to tell you in a way that sounds new
It's so old-fashioned - but that's the way I feel for you
I'd heard the music of Marvin Gaye
But I finally understood it today
I heard the record like I never had before
And I just want to say thank you
For everything you do
Thank you for all the things that you do Your love and kindness are heaven-sent
Now I know exactly what the man meant
When he said "Thank you for lettin' me be myself"And now I know without a doubt
Just what Sam & Dave were talking about
You didn't have to, but you did just what you did
And I gotta say thank you
For everything you do
Thank you for all the things that you do You've heard the title a thousand times
Same old message but I'm makin' it mine'Cause I'm so thankful that you came into my life
And I just gotta say thank you
For everything you do
Thank you for all the things that you do
