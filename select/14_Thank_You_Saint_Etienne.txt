Transcribed by Dean Hotta

I found some time to stop and think it over.
And all I know is thank you

Chorus:
I never knew where to begin.
Or where it would end.
I never knew where to begin.
Ooooh

I want to be exactly where you're going.
The land, the sea.
Thank you
(Repeat chorus to fade)

Composition:
Cracknell
Stanley
Wiggs
